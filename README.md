# Data-Visualization-of-US-Accidents

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize US traffic accident data from February 2016 to December 2020. The resulting dashboard and visualizations will provide insights into accident frequency, severity, causes, and distribution across states and regions. This information can be used by stakeholders to develop policies to reduce accidents in the future.

## Outcome
The project yielded a comprehensive analysis of US accident data, highlighting patterns and trends in accidents through data visualization techniques. The resulting insights can inform policy decisions and targeted interventions to improve public safety and reduce the incidence and severity of accidents, ultimately saving lives.

## Methods and Results
The project used publicly available data from the US Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) General Estimates System (GES) to collect information about accidents that occurred on US roads between 2016 and 2019. The dataset was cleaned, processed, and transformed into a format suitable for analysis and visualization using SQL. The final dataset included 1.06 million records with 18 columns.

The project showcased several visualizations, including the number of accidents in each state, accidents by time and severity, accidents based on weather condition and street side, and accidents based on the visibility of the road. The visualizations were made interactive using calculated fields, parameters, filters, and reference lines.

## Impact
The project has the potential to impact transportation and safety sectors by providing data-driven insights into traffic accidents, their frequency, severity, causes, and distribution across different states and regions in the country. The insights from the project can be used by stakeholders to identify accident-prone areas and develop targeted interventions and policies to improve public safety and reduce the number of accidents.
